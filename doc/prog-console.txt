Using OpenAMQ Console Automation
********************************

This document explains how to write applications that automate management of
OpenAMQ servers via console automation. The OpenAMQ console automation
architecture offers developers different ways of accessing the functionality of
the console API and integrating it with their own preferred tools and management
facilities.

Overview
********

What is OpenAMQ console automation?
===================================

Console automation offers system administrators a way to automatically or
manually manage OpenAMQ servers from a central point. OpenAMQ offers a standard
'shell' that provides the basic automation functionality but in some cases this
shell is too limited.

In this document we explain how the console automation architecture offers
developers different ways of extending the functionality and integrate it with
their own preferred tools and management facilities.

Architecture
============

The request for comments "AMQP Console Interface" (RFC-CML) defines a standard
way to access AMQP servers for the purposes of management. OpenAMQ implements
this specification and is interoperable with all tools and applications that
conform to the RFC-CML specification.

OpenAMQ provides a CML schema that documents the OpenAMQ server-side entities,
their properties, and all methods allowed on them.

For developers, OpenAMQ provides a client-side console API that implements CML
to speak to an AMQP server. This API is specific to an OpenAMQ schema but
OpenAMQ includes tools to generate new C/C++ APIs for arbitrary CML schemas.

In this document we explain:

# The OpenAMQ CML schema.
# How to use the OpenAMQ console API.
# How to generate new APIs for other CML schemas.

OpenAMQ CML schema
******************

CML is the XML language defined in the RFC-CML specifications.  The OpenAMQ CML
tree defines these classes (nested as shown here):

    broker
        exchange
        queue
            queue_connection
        connection
            connection_queue
        config

The current CML schema, showing the fields and methods for each class, is:

The OpenAMQ console API
***********************

Resources
=========

The console API consists of a set of functions in the libamq_operate library.
To use these functions you need all libraries in $IBASE/lib, and you need these
header files in your C/C++ application:

    #include "icl.h"
    #include "amq_mgt_console.h"
    #include "amq_mgt_broker.h"

The simplest way to build and link your applications is using the iMatix Boom
system.  However you can use whatever processes you are already using to develop
WireAPI applications, these will also work.

The amq_mgt_console class
=========================

To talk to an OpenAMQ server, an application creates and uses an object of the
class amq_mgt_console.  This object acts as the container for the CML data tree
representing the last received state of the remote server.

To create a new amq_mgt_console the application uses the 'new' method, passing
connection data:

    amq_mgt_console_t
        *console;
    console = amq_mgt_console_new (host, vhost, login, password);
    if (!console)
        exit (-1);

The amq_mgt_console object has these properties, all child objects:

    amq_client_connection_t
        *connection;                    //  Current connection
    amq_client_session_t
        *session;                       //  Current session
    amq_mgt_broker_t
        *broker;                        //  Top-level object

We can use the connection to report information about the remote server:

    icl_console_out ("Connected to %s/%s on %s\n",
        console->connection->server_product,
        console->connection->server_version,
        console->connection->server_host);

Normally we don't use the session object, this is used internally by the console
API.  The broker object is the top level of the CML tree, we'll see how to use
that next.

When the application is finished with talking to the server, it destroys the
console using this method:

    amq_mgt_console_destroy (&console);

Which releases all memory used by the console and closes the connection to the
OpenAMQ server.

Console objects
===============

Creating and destroying objects
-------------------------------

The API automatically creates and destroys objects, so you should never use the
'new' and 'destroy' methods on API objects except amq_mgt_console itself.

Object properties
-----------------

All objects have these properties, which are read-only and must not be modified
by calling applications:

 - id: an integer identifier for the object.  Used internally by the API.
 - notice: a string that holds the last error message from the server, if any.
 - all fields defined in the CML layout for the object.
 - all child classes, either as single items ('amq_mgt_childname_t *child') or
   as loose reference lists.

Loading an object
-----------------

The console API does lazy loading, that is, it fetches data only when needed.
This cuts traffic and lets console applications work with specific objects
faster.

Before accessing the properties or children of an object the caller must load
the object using the 'load' method, e.g.:

    amq_mgt_connection_load (connection);

Certain other methods automatically do a 'load', as noted below.  If the load
method fails, it returns a non-zero value.  This means either that the server
went offline, or (more typically) that the remote object no longer exists.

Printing an object
------------------

There are three methods that print details about an object:

 - print_properties: prints object's properties in two-column list.  Does a load
   automatically.
 - print_children: prints a summary of all children. Does a load automatically.
 - print_summary: prints a summary of the single object.  Does not load the
   object automatically.

For example, to print information about the broker and then show a summary of
all its child objects:

    amq_mgt_broker_print_properties (console->broker, NULL);
    amq_mgt_broker_print_children   (console->broker, NULL);

Or, to print the summary of all connections active for the broker:

    amq_mgt_connection_t
        *connection;                //  Child connection
    amq_mgt_broker_load (console->broker);
    
    connection = amq_mgt_broker_connection_first (console->broker);
    while (connection) {
        amq_mgt_connection_load (connection);
        amq_mgt_connection_print_summary (connection, NULL);
        connection = amq_mgt_broker_connection_next (console->broker);
    }

Object tree navigation
----------------------

As we noted above, the CML schema for OpenAMQ provides these object classes:

    broker
        exchange
        queue
            queue_connection
        connection
            connection_queue
        config

The console API delivered with OpenAMQ maps this tree directly to a hierarchical
C/C++ API, that is, to a set of functions that let you explicitly navigate
through the object tree.

This is simplest to understand from an example.  Here we navigate through the
connections for the broker, which is the root object.  The broker is accessed as
'console->broker'.

Before we can navigate any object we have to load it.  The 'load' method fetches
the object state from the OpenAMQ server:

    amq_mgt_broker_load (console->broker);

Having loaded an object we can navigate its children.  To do this we use the
'first' and 'next' methods as follows:

    amq_mgt_connection_t
        *connection;                //  Child connection
    
    connection = amq_mgt_broker_connection_first (console->broker);
    while (connection) {
        //  Do something useful with the connection
        connection = amq_mgt_broker_connection_next (console->broker);
    }

Note that if an object 'Y' has a child object - as shown on the CML object tree
for OpenAMQ - called 'X' then the API will have functions called
amq_mgt_Y_X_first and amq_mgt_Y_X_next.  The 'first' method returns an object
reference or null, if there are no children of the specified class.  The 'next'
method returns an object reference, or null if there are no more children of
that type.  If you do 'next' again (or without doing a 'first') you get the
first child object, if any.

XML data capture
================

The print methods take two arguments: the object reference and an optional FILE
pointer.  The FILE, if not null, refers to an XML stream that has been opened
for writing.  In this case the output is sent to that XML stream rather than the
terminal window.

The caller must properly write the XML file header and footer, it can use
arbitrary tags to wrap the list of elements output by the console API. Here is
an example of using the XML data capture:

    FILE
        *xml_data = NULL;               //  XML capture stream
    
    xml_data = fopen ("server_state.xml", "w");
    fprintf (xml_data, "<?xml?>\n");
    fprintf (xml_data, "<console_data>\n");
    amq_mgt_broker_print_properties (console->broker, xml_data);
    amq_mgt_broker_print_children   (console->broker, xml_data);
    fprintf (xml_data, "</console_data>\n");
    fclose (xml_data);

Command-line processing
=======================

The console API includes a simple command line processor that lets you:

 1. Provide the user with an interactive shell.
 2. Execute methods on remote objects.

The 'cmdline' method works on all objects. It automatically loads the object
before working on it. It has these arguments:

 - path: a string that is used as the command prompt.  Usually we pass the
   server hostname but an empty string ("") also works well.
 - depth: the 'depth' of the current path - when this is zero, the shell will
   not accept the '..' command.  Use zero when you are calling the 'cmdline'
   method on the broker object.
 - tokens: an ipr_token_list containing one or more tokens to execute, can be
   NULL.
 - file: an optional XML file for capturing output, can be NULL.

The 'cmdline' method return code, if not zero, has these meanings:

 - 1: the user asked to move to the parent object (navigation 'up').
 - 2: the user asked to move to the top-level (broker) object.
 - 3: the user asked to exit the shell.

Here, for example, is how to provide the user with an interactive shell for
managing a broker:

    amq_mgt_broker_cmdline (console->broker, "", 0, NULL, NULL);

The syntax that the shell provides is:

    Command               Has this effect
    -------               -------------------
    ls [child] [pattern]  Show matching children
    top [child]           Show most important children
    cd [nnn]              Look at item [number nnn]
    nnn                   Look at item number nnn
    /                     Return to broker item
    .                     Show current item
    ..                    Move back to previous item
    set name value        Set object property
    help                  Show this text
    exit | quit           Leave the console shell
    methodname            CML method on the object

Here is how to lock a broker using the 'lock' method.  The CML fragment, to
remind you, is:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <schema-reply name = "openamq.org/kernel" version = "0.3" status = "ok">
       <class name = "broker" label = "Broker">
          ...
          <method name = "lock" label = "Prevent new connections">
              <field name = "setting" label = "1|0" type = "bool" />
          </method>
       </class>
       ...

And we automate this as follows (having already created the console):

    ipr_token_list_t
        *tokens = ipr_token_split ("lock 1");
    amq_mgt_broker_cmdline (console->broker, "", 0, tokens, NULL);
    ipr_token_list_destroy (&tokens);

Runtime options
===============

The console API has these runtime options, set as global variables:

    int
        g_opt_trace = 0;            //  If 1, 2, 3 does protocol trace
    Bool
        g_opt_addr = FALSE;         //  If true, does RDNS lookups (slow)

Worked example
==============

The following program connects to a broker, prints summary information about it,
and then shuts it down:

Building new APIs
*****************

Overview
========

OpenAMQ relies very heavily on code generation, which turns slow and clumsy C
development into something much more modern.  The console API is a good example
- it is 100% generated from the CML schema.  This can be done at runtime in
languages like Python.

Our code generation relies on GSL, the language developed by iMatix to generate
code from XML models.  GSL is a minimalist code generation language and lets us
produce high-quality code with modest effort.

Here is part of the script that generates the console API:

    xml from "amq_console_schema.xml"
    for ->root.class
    .template
    .if !defined (switches.quiet)
    .   echo "Generating amq_mgt_$(name).icl..."
    .endif
    .output "amq_mgt_$(name).icl"
    <?xml?>
    <class
        name      = "amq_mgt_$(name)"
        comment   = "Management console $(name) class"
        version   = "1.0"
        script    = "icl_gen"
        >
    <doc>
    Implements the management console $(name) object, used by applications
    to manage OpenAMQ servers. Use in conjunction with the amq_mgt_console
    class.
    </doc>
    
    <inherit class = "icl_object">
        <option name = "alloc" value = "cache" />
    </inherit>
    
    <import class = "amq_mgt_console" />
    .for class
    <import class = "amq_mgt_$(name)" />
    .endfor

Note that this script does not generate C/C++, it generates iCL (our XML class
language).  While the final C/C++ code is about 20K lines, the original input
XML is 1,191 lines.

Code generation process
=======================

The current code generation process works as follows:

1. The openamq/server/amq_console_schema.gsl script walks all OpenAMQ objects
  starting with amq_broker, and extracts the CML tree from these objects.
2. The script generates a matching CML file and saves the extracted data tree as
  amq_console_schema.xml.
3. The openamq/operate/amq_operate_api.gsl script takes that XML data (not the
  CML, which has insufficient data) and generates a set of iCL classes to
  implement the API.
4. These iCL classes are built into C code and compiled along with the rest of
  the OpenAMQ source tree.

Thus, if you want to exploit this code generation you will need to copy and
modify the two GSL scripts, amq_console_schema.gsl and amq_operate_api.gsl.
