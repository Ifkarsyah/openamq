++ Architecture and design

OpenAMQ is not just a technology, it is also a design philosophy.  The AMQ semantics are a powerful way to design distributed applications.  OpenAMQ takes care of detailed routing and queueing, and you can focus your architecture on the aspects that matter to you.

If you need advice or help, drop us a line.  If we can help by email or phone, we will.  Otherwise, ask for an OpenAMQ expert to drop by your offices - whether you're in Singapore or San Francisco, Brussels or Bangkok, we're happy to walk through your business architecture with you.

++ Low latency trials

iMatix is starting trials of its new low latency OpenAMQ/2.0 product.  If your business demands latencies of under 100 microseconds, and throughputs of 1 GB or more, contact us to ask to participate in our low latency trial programme.  OpenAMQ/2.0 is scheduled for release by 4th quarter of 2008.
