Conformance Tests
*****************

 5. "Conformance Tests", in which we explain the conformance test
    framework, which asserts that an AMQ server conforms to the functional
    and technical specifications defined in this document. This chapter
    consists of a short explanation of how the conformance tests are
    designed, followed by a detailed specification of each conformance
    test, intended as a reference for implementors. You can read this
    chapter by itself.

Introduction
============

The AMQ conformance tests are designed to assert that an AMQ server
actually conforms to the specifications.

Design
======

We test:

 - Mandatory functionality: the server MUST support this.
 - Optional functionality: the server MAY or SHOULD support this.
 - Argument handling: all rules applying to method arguments.
 - Limit handling: the stability of the server at its limits.
 - Entity lifecycles: the handling of entity creation/deletion.
 - Error handling: the handling of each possible error case.
 
We do not test the AMQ client, only the server.
