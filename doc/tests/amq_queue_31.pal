    This test opens a session, declares an auto_delete queue and checks if a
    redeclaration ignores the auto_delete field.
    <!--
        - declare queue without auto-delete
        - declare queue with auto-delete
        - consume from queue
        - cancel consumer
        - wait for auto-delete timeout
        - queue must still be present
