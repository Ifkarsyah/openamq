AMQP/Fast topic names form a hierarchy of names delimited by dots, e.g.

    a
    a.b.c
    a.b.c.d

Pattern matching on this hierarchy uses the special characters '*' and
'#', which match one and any number of topic name parts respectively.

//TODO: define the formal class/method specification language in
an AMQ RFC.
//TODO: reorganise the AMQ RFC directory to separate working drafts
from RFCs, rename all unused RFCs as working drafts.
