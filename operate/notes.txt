Changes

- queue detail should list consumers with connection data
    -> consumer needs to be changed to async object
    -> consumer needs to be added to console schema
- from connection, show all consumed queues, not just private queues
    -> need to add list of queues at connection level

- allow wildcard matching on ls command (on object name, I guess)
- use 'cd' plus number to navigate

Postponed

- show all non-private queues at top level (broker)

Cannot do

- emulate file system interface

Done

- show exchange type for last binding in queue properties
- show routing key for last binding in queue properties
- send normal output to STDOUT not STDERR
- make IP translation optional
- add total messages in, out to queues, and show on summary
- add total messages in, out to broker and show on summary (if not already done)
- show messages pending on queues (inad) in number and MB
- do not display objects on [Enter], require an 'ls' command
