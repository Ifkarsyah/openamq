    Test script for AMQ-448 ("No reply received - timeout")

    Should show the problem reproducible in revisions up to 9020 inclusive.
    To reproduce, run server on eqd-lxcc01 and client on eqd-deve12 or
    eqd-deve14.  You will need to run at least 200 instances of the client.
    If the problem does not occur, try increasing the "count" variable.
