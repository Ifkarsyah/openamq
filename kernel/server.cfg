        OpenAMQ server primary configuration file
        Do not edit this file.  To define a custom configuration,
        especially for security data and cluster configuration,
        edit "custom.cfg", or pass configuration options on the
        command line.

        Security data and cluster configuration, and queue and user
        group profiles cannot be defined on the command-line or via
        the shell. This file provides example sections that you can
        copy to custom.cfg.

        Run "amq_server --help" for options help.

         Valid actions are:

            drop - drop the message
            trim - remove old messages from queue
            kill - kill the connection and queue (not yet implemented)

         The order of queue limits is important.
