      - framing code did not properly free memory after a framing error
      - fixed consume command confirmation, which came after notifies,
        rather than before

pfe
0.8c1 - 2005/04/26

 - porting to Solaris/sparc (APR changes)

0.8c0 - 2005/04/16

Changes to server kernel:

  - started implementation of topics.

Changes to client kernel:

  - kernel client layer now supports topic destinations.

0.8b4 - 2005/04/14

Changes to server kernel:

  - login/password validation was broken due to error in amq_field class, 
    fixed.

  - amq_queue class broken into class hierarchy: amq_mesgq, amq_dest,
    amq_queue, amq_topic, and amq_subsc.

  - 'core' project renamed to 'kernel'.

  - removed NONE security mechanism; all clients must now login correctly.

0.8b3 - 2006/04/07

Changes to server:

  - Server deletes (old) unused queue backing files at startup.  Previously
    these were left in the data subdirectory.

  - Destination backing files now given unique name (using a simple hash).
    Previously two queues ("a-b", "a/b") could map to the same backing
    file name.

  - Destinations can now be configured using templates.  This lets you
    tune large numbers of destinations (e.g. topics) by modifying a single
    template.  The "default" template is used by default for normal
    destinations, and "temporary" for temporary destinations.

Changes to clients:

0.8b2 - 2005/04/06 - internal

  - server now creates and opens queue persistence files 'lazily',
    allowing pure in-memory queues.

  - amq_message class was ignoring persistent setting in testfill method;
    thus serial client "persistent" option had no effect - fixed.

  - openamq server now purges memory (50% purge) when it reaches the
    preset server limit.

  - HANDLE BROWSE fixed to return accurate message number (was always
    zero).

  - HANDLE REPLY, CHANNEL REPLY were not being sent at end of logical
    unit of work, but at start.  This has now been fixed.

0.8b1 - 2005/03/28

  - server correctly negotiates channel shut-down in case of soft
    errors (e.g. transaction too large).

  - serial and asynch clients modified to handle channel & handle
    shut-down better.

  - first version of agnostic level 2 client finished.

  - now uses dynamic buckets for more efficient storage of in-memory
    messages (previously used fixed bucket size of 32k).

  - serial test client was not using accurate batch sizes - fixed.

0.8b0 - 2005/03/23

  - transaction handling substantially rewritten to work around
    limitations of BDB subsystem.

  - consumers were improperly counted at disconnection, so server
    would eventually report "Too many consumers" for queue - fixed.

  - server misbehaved on some boxes when client disconnected abruptly;
    caused by bug in SMT layer - fixed.

  - server mishandled ACKs sent in batches of 1 with the result that
    it would wrongly treat the queue as being "full" when it was not.

  - server now automatically rollsback a transaction if the client
    disconnects during an open transaction.

  - server sometimes blocked when committing messages; problem was
    caused by misuse of BDB transaction handles (fixed).

  - if client disconnects before committing acknowledgements, the
    affected messages are released for dispatching to other clients.

0.8a0 - 14 March 2005
    - when server exceeds allowed memory, displays console warning
    - implemented transaction limit (TXN_LIMIT in CONNECTION TUNE)
    - server core updated to AMQP/0.8
    - asynch and serial clients updated to AMQP/0.8
    - implemented layered configuration files (amq_custom.cfg)
    - first draft of openamq server documentation

0.7d2 - 10 March 2005
    - added queue 'page-size' option for disk page control
    - added queue 'extent-size' option for file extent (in pages)
    - added queue 'block-size' option for block size (physical record)

0.7d1 - 9 March 2005
    - fixed 'unreliable' HANDLE CONSUME option which auto-acks messages
    - added 'get content' method to amq_message class
    - added Java client and chat program
    - added chat programs to stdc clients (these work with the Java chat)
    - fixed some portability issues for Win32

0.7d0 - 9 March 2005
