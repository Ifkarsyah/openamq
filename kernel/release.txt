  - Exchange, queue, and scope names are now validated in the
    Declare methods.  These names may now contain only [A-Za-z0-9_].
    System objects (predeclared) start with $.
  - Removed template field from queue.declare method. Templating
    will be done using the domain value.
  - Queue "domain" field renamed to "scope".
  - Predefined "$queue" (dest-name) and "$topic" (dest-wild) exchanges.
  - Implemented the "dest-wild" exchange (for topic-style routing).
  - Added option to trace exchange and queueing workflow, configurable
    in server.cfg.
  - C/C++ client API was not working in single-threaded builds - fixed.
  - OpenAMQ kernel, C/C++ client now uses new Base2 object reference
    framework.
  - C/C++ client API made much more robust its internal queues.
  - Server leaked memory if interrupted after all connections closed.
  - Improved socket tracing display in server.
  - In rare cases when consumer disconnected, server would continue to
    send it messages, causing memory leaks - fixed.
  - C client agent sometimes tried to write to destroyed queue, causing
    abort - fixed.
  - Cancelling a consumer failed often, due to error in server channel
    class - fixed.
