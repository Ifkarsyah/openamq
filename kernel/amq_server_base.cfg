        OpenAMQ server primary configuration file
        
        ** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE **  
        
        To define a custom configuration, especially for security data and 
        cluster configuration, edit "custom.cfg", or pass configuration options
        on the command line.

        Security data and cluster configuration, and queue and user group
        profiles cannot be defined on the command-line or via the shell. This
        file provides example sections that you can copy to custom.cfg.

        Run "amq_server --help" for options help.

        <server name = "cluster-003" host = "localhost:5002"  />
    <cluster
        vhost = "/"
        host = ""
        state_mb = "250"
        heartbeat = "5"

    <!-- These are default queue profiles:
         Valid actions are:
            warn - send message to alert log
            drop - drop the message
            trim - remove old messages from queue
            kill - kill the connection and queue

         Note that if you define a drop/trim action, the queue will never
         grow larger than the specified limit.

         Please define limits in ascending order.
