        OpenAMQ server primary configuration file

        ** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE **

        To define a custom configuration, especially for security data and
        cluster configuration, edit "amq_server.cfg", or pass configuration options
        on the command line.

        Security data and cluster configuration, and queue and user group
        profiles cannot be defined on the command-line or via the shell. This
        file provides example sections that you can copy to custom.cfg.

        Run "amq_server --help" for options help.

    <!-- Sample cluster configuration
        - The vhost must be the same as used by applications at connect time
        - The internal address, if specified, is used for intra-cluster work
        - The host address is provided to clients
    <cluster
        vhost = "/"
        heartbeat = "5"
        >
        <server
            name = "cluster-001"
            host = "si200505:5001"
            internal = "localhost:5001"
            primary = "1" />
        <server
            name = "cluster-002"

    <!-- These are default queue profiles:
         Valid actions are:
            warn - send message to alert log
            drop - drop the message
            trim - remove old messages from queue
            kill - kill the connection and queue

         Note that if you define a drop/trim action, the queue will never
         grow larger than the specified limit.

         Please define limits in ascending order.
