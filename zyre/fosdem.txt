Fosdem presentation

something controversial
    90% of software is crap
    so why this is not...

start with some wisdom / jokes...
rules of programming
    - use short words
    - give every piece a good name
    - put every piece in a good place
    - explain how it fits together
    - only develop on-demand
    - publish the specs first
    - always generalise
    - complexity is a bug
    - perfection = simplicity
    - fix first, then extend
    - use boring (and safe) tools
    - make your own (boring) tools
    - choose competent clients
    - write for normal readers
    - publish early and often
    - learn to touch type
    - work very, very hard
    - bad design should offend
    - it's a social science
    - design for the long run
    - exploit Heironymous' Law
    - if it needs ten cups of coffee to understand, it's too complex: rewrite it
    - if you can (still) understand it when you're drunk, it's probably simple enough

explain SOA
    - what, why
explain AMQP
    - what, why
simplicity
    - belly, enterprise, SOAP, WS.
KISS - REST

SOA is finally cool
 =- slashdot quotez

AMQP in 30 seconds
 = message flow
 = example apps

OpenAMQ
 = history, project, goals
 = challenges

Where to next?
 = fat belly
 = easy to use
 = ... REST
 => RestMS

- a new web server
    - secure, easy to configure, scalable, light
- a new messaging architecture
- a new messaging server
    - RESTful, pure HTTP, XML, JSON
- a new wtf?

REST in 30 seconds
