++ AMQP interoperability and security

RESTful extensions to AMQP
    - RestMS protocol class
    - * in topics matches empty routing-key
    - empty topic segments are allowed (".value")
    - Basic.Consume is assertive, idempotent
        - note that must not allow same tag on different queues
        -> Subsumed in restms protocol class
    - Queue.Declare private queues are scoped per connection
        - names uniquified on server, automatically
        - in declare, consume, cancel, bind, delete
        -> This is not implemented in OpenAMQ yet but should be
        -> Subsumed in restms protocol class
    - Queue.Delete is assertive
        - if queue does not exist, still returns Delete-Ok
        -> Subsumed in restms protocol class
