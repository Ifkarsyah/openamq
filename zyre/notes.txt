incoming message
    - always make separate content
    - create content resource
    - pass bucket of content & type
    - create message resource
    - attach content to message
    - attach message to pipe

get pipe
    - list messages
    - add asynclet

get message
    - if synchronous,
        get message details
    - if asynchronous
        wait until message arrives
    - list content, plus size etc.

get asynclet


        amq_content_basic_list_queue (self->contents, content);

- message class
    - address
    - reply_to
    - list of contents
    - feed (originating)




get content from feed
    if know URI

need to learn GIT and make gitub for restms work
    - specs, sample code
    - addons

    - binaries, packages


JSON parser in C
new XML parser that is known solid

synchronization with AMQP
    - what feeds come from OpenAMQ:
        - shared queues -> feedname
        - all exchanges
    - when AMQP provides feed,
        - create in restms object if new


new resource from openamq
    always public resource
    always locked

- in openamq, synchronize back with zyre
    - add method Feed.Sync to class
    - if server gets this, syncs all exchange & shared queues back to RestMS



AMQP synchronization
    - resource->private property

zyre_content class
    content_type
    content_encoding
    bucket (limit content to 2MB for now)
        overflow to file, later
        limitation needs to be documented


define pipe that sends messages back to feed
    - allows proxy selection, macroisation

define fair queue mechanism that takes input from several feeds but fairly
    - implement natively in openamq?
    - ...?



Implement exchange logic in zyre and do federation

config
    amqp server name
    amqp server login and password
    client logins
        - basic auths
        - not same as openamq credentials


RESTful extensions to AMQP
    - RestMS protocol class
    - * in topics matches empty routing-key
    - empty topic segments are allowed (".value")
