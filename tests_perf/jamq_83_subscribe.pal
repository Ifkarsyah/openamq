    jamq_83_publish/jamq_83_subscribe

    These PAL scripts can be used to test for several problems in the server
    and client layers.  The publisher simply publishes a stream of 500 byte
    messages to the broker for ever.  The subscriber will connect, wait for a 
    single message to arrive and exit.

    Example test scenario:

        jamq_83_subscribe
        (while [ 1 ]; do ./jamq_83_publish || exit; done)

<pal script = "amq_pal_gen">

        <basic_consume queue = "$queue" />
        <wait/>
        <basic_arrived>
            <echo>Got a message</echo>
        </basic_arrived>
