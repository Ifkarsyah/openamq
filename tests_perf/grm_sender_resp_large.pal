    Publishes a stable stream of "response" messages to the "grm.r" exchange.
    Intended for use as a sender for "large" messages, to simulate the occasional
    multi-megabyte response to a GTW GUI query.

    Command line arguments:
    -A interval between messages (in miliseconds)
    -B size of a message (in bytes, default 15MB)
    -M message ID (default is YRSS)
    -S sync ID (default is YRSS-SYNC)
    <set name = "delay_cmdline" value = "60000" cmdline = "A" />

    <set name = "msg_id" value = "YRSS" cmdline = "M" />
