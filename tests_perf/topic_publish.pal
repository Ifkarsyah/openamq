    topic_publish/topic_subscribe

    These PAL scripts are used to test a publish/subscribe scenario
    using a topic exchange.  topic_publish sends a series of messages to
    a topic exchange and waits for a confirmation from each subscriber
    that it has read the entire series.  topic_subscribe subscribes to
    these messages.  You should tell topic_publish how many subcribers
    there are (default = 1).

    To use:

        topic_subscribe
        topic_publish -M messages -S subscribers

    The -T option causes the scripts to set-up a number of topics that
    are used for nothing except to load the topic exchange.
