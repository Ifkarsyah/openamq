Abstract
========

We define the module classes that OpenAMQ uses.  Each module class is
implemented by an iCL class definition that specifies its API and provides
a test framework.

Module Classes
**************

These module types are implemented or formally proposed:

amq_mod_if:
    The base module interface class, not used actively.
amq_term_if:
    Interface class for terminals. A terminal talks to external clients
    via an AMQP protocol.
amq_driv_if:
    Interface class for drivers. A driver handles a set of destinations.
amq_disp_if:
    Interface class for dispatchers.  A dispatcher calculates message
    forwarding based on client requests.

We will probably also define the following module types:

amq_pars_if:
    Interface class for parsers. A parser extracts matching criteria from
    messages and requests.
amq_filt_if:
    Interface class for filters.  A filter can modify messages being sent
    to destinations or to clients.
amq_cons_if:
    Interface class for consoles.  A console receives log data and errors
    and can take appropriate action.

Security Considerations
=======================

This proposal does not have any specific security considerations.
