Instructions on Building from Source
************************************

Last updated: 2005/03/18 by ph@imatix.com

Requirements
============

 - a POSIX box with ANSI C compiler, or
 - a Win32 box with MSVC/6 or MSVC/7
 - zip or tar and gunzip

This package has been qualified for Linux, Windows 2000+ Sun Solaris. Your
milage will vary on other POSIX boxes.

The .tar.gz package and .zip packages are identical except that the text
files they contain are formatted for POSIX and Windows respectively.  You
can convert line endings using zip (-l and -a options) but we suggest you
simply unpack the appropriate file.

Instructions
============

Select an installation directory.  For instance, c:\home or $HOME.  This
is where the compiled/linked programs will be installed.  We call this
the IBASE directory.

After unzipping/detarring, change to the freshly created directory and
run the 'configure' command:

    configure --with-ibase=IBASE-DIRECTORY

Alternatively, define an environment variable 'IBASE' with this directory
as its value.

Now build using this command:

    boomake build install

To use the installed tools in your projects, ensure that IBASE/bin is on
your PATH.

Details
=======

Under Win32 the MS C/C++ compiler must be configured for command-line
use.  During MSVC installation, make sure you register the environment
variables needed for command-line use of the compiler.  Check the
vcvars32.bat script for correctness.  When you open a console box, the
MSVCDir variable must point correctly to the MSVC application directory.
You can set this in the system environment variables.

Requires some C99 functionality, may not build on older C compilers.

To build a debugging version use the configure command:

    configure --enable-debugging
