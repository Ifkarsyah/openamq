message handling

        manages two priority levels (normal, high)
        for non-persistent messages only

Message priorities effectively split the queue into sub-queues.  High-priority
messages are delivered before low-priority messages.  The openamq server lets 
you configure how many sub-queues you want, per queue:

E.g. (from vh_test/amq_vhost.cfg):

        <queue
            name = "test"
            priority-levels = "2"
        />

Persistent messages are always treated as lowest priority.  In general the 
server will deliver higher-priority non-persistent messages ahead of any 
persistent messages.

If the queue memory limit (max messages) is reached, high-priority messages 
are still accepted in memory, all the rest are queued on disk as persistent 
messages.
