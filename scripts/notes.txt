All,

Here is the nth iteration of this layer, broken down into pieces we
think we can actually make:

1. buildsvn - updates, checks out svn, does a full or partial rebuild,
runs regression tests and reports success/failure.  Arguments: build
model.

2. buildsrc - makes new source kits based on current built svn tree.
Replaces the old 'makesrc'.

3. buildbin - unpacks source kit, builds binary files, builds binary
kits.  Arguments: build model.

4. upload - uploads source kits and/or binary kits to a well-defined server.

5. release - downloads source and binary kits, renames to current
release, and uploads to public distribution server.  Updates web site
accordingly.

6. autobuild - overall manager, integrates these pieces into coherent
processes.

We will make write the code as perl + Libero.  The scripts will be in
openamq/packaging.  Mato will make first drafts of the Libero dialogs
and perl code where possible; Pieter and Tim will finish this work.

Deadline is end of next week.

-Pieter
