    amq_server.cfg - OpenAMQ primary configuration file

    This file provides the basic customisable configuration for
    the OpenAMQ server.

    Queues, topics, and other virtual-host specific values are
    customised separately in each virtual-host configuration file.
    Note that each virtual host has in its own operating directory
    that holds a configuration file called "amq_vhost.cfg".
