WireAPI - a Standard AMQP API
*****************************

Describes a standard API for application developers that wish to use
the AMQP for messaging services in their applications.  WireAPI is
currently a C API but is intended to evolve into a standard language-neutral
API that gives developers full access to the full functionality of the
AMQP protocol.
