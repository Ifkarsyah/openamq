Tuning Principles
*****************

OpenAMQ provides a wide set of tuning options.  Before you start tuning
your server, please note that:

 * The default installation is already tuned for general performance.
   While we encourage you to experiment to understand how your OpenAMQ
   server behaves, tuning is not an essential part of normal OpenAMQ usage.

 * When tuning, make sure you have a good test platform so that you can
   measure the impact of each choice.  It is quite easy to make the
   performance of a server worse by making the wrong kind of tuning.

 * Test each option independently on the command-line before adding it
   to a configuration file.

 * You can tune the WireAPI client libraries with many of the same options
   as those for the server.

Process Tuning
**************

These are the options that affect the server process:

max_memory_mb = "512":
    Specifies the maximum memory allowed for the server, in MB. When the
    server reaches this limit, it will slow down publishers. If zero, no
    limit is enforced. Default value is 512. This option can be changed at
    runtime. *Note:* This option is not functional in the current release
    ($(main_version)), and will be reviewed and fixed in the next release.
polling_threads = "4":
    On multithreaded builds, defines the number of OS threads dedicated to
    socket polling. Default value is 4.
working_threads = "4":
    On multithreaded builds, defines the number of OS threads dedicated to
    processing, that is, tasks other than socket polling. Default value is
    4.

Network Tuning
**************

These are the options that affect network configuration and performance:

heartbeat = "2":
    Defines the timeout for connection heartbeating. Default value is 2.
    This option can be changed at runtime.
tcp_nodelay = "1":
    If this value is 1, socket data is written immediately, which is
    usually good for latency. If this value is 0, data is buffered until
    there is a full packet, which is usually good for throughput. Default
    value is 1. This option can be changed at runtime.
tcp_rcvbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 0.
    This option can be changed at runtime.
tcp_sndbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 0.
    This option can be changed at runtime.

*Note:* We recommend that rather than tuning the tcp_rcvbuf and tcp_sndbuf
options at the application level, you should rely on the default values of "0"
and tune your operating system's TCP stack appropriately. For a good guide to
TCP Tuning, see [http://www-didc.lbl.gov/TCP-tuning/:here].

Tuning the WireAPI Client Layers
********************************

The WireAPI layers are not configurable via the command line, so you
will want to create an XML configuration file to tune this layer.

The file must be called *wireapi.cfg* and must be located on the
PATH, or in the current directory where the applications are run.

Use the same format for this file as for the server configuration file,
e.g.

    &lt;?xml?&gt;
    &lt;config&gt;
        &lt;tuning
            tcp_rcvbuf = "128000"
            tcb_sndbuf = "128000"
            heartbeat = "5"
        /&gt;
    &lt;/config&gt;

Testing Throughput
******************

The standard test tool for performance is amq_client.  This sends a
number of messages to a private temporary queue, and reads the messages
back off that queue.

Start the server with monitoring enabled (so that it displays the traffic
rate):

    amq_server --monitor 1

Start multiple instances of amq_client on one or a series of test systems:

    amq_client -s !server:port! -n 20000 -x 500 -r 0

This is an example of the monitor output produced by the server:

    I: incoming rate=2545 mean=2392 peak=4115
    I: outgoing rate=2545 mean=2392 peak=4114 iomean=4784

 - The incoming rate represents the number of messages (AMQP contents) read
   off the network each second.

 - The outgoing rate represents the number of messages written to the network
   each second.

 - The *mean* rates represent a rolling average per second calculated over the
   previous ten seconds.

 - The *peak* rates represent the highest value over the previous ten seconds.

 - the *iomean* rate represents the combined input and output average per second
   calculated over the last ten seconds.

When you tune the server performance, it is the iomean that you should be aiming
to improve.

Tuning FAQ

 - !How do I write my own test scripts?! Answer: use the [/pal.html:PAL scripting language]
   that is included with OpenAMQ.
