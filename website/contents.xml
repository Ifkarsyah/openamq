Source Packages
***************

OpenAMQ Source Code
===================

The openamq directory contains the full source code for the OpenAMQ project.

 - openamq/kernel - The OpenAMQ server kernel code (ANSI C)
 - openamq/clients - The OpenAMQ client API implementations
   (ANSI C, C++, COM, Java)
 - openamq/server - A sample server configuration

iMatix Technology Packages
==========================

A set of software engineering tools focussing on infrastructure design
and development.  We use these tools extensively in the OpenAMQ server and
clients.

 - base - a package of ANSI-C tools and libraries
 - base2 - XML-based code generation frameworks
 - gsl4 - the iMatix XML-based code generator

Each package contains documentation.  This will eventually be put online at
imatix.com (we are revising this site, slowly).

3rd Party Packages
==================

We use a number of external open source packages in OpenAMQ.  We
include the most recent validated versions of these in the OpenAMQ source
packages.  (see source directory "base2/foreign").

 - base2/foreign/apr - the Apache Portable Runtime
 - base2/foreign/bdb - the Berkeley Database system
