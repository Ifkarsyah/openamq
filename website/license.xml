License FAQ
***********

 - !How are my applications affected by these licenses?!

   distribute proprietary products based on the OpenAMQ server source code.

 - !How much does an OEM license cost?! Answer: please send us an email to
   sales at iMatix dot com, with a description of your OEM product plan or
   proposal.

 - !Is the free OpenAMQ software complete?! Answer: we don't believe in
   crippleware.  We strive to make OpenAMQ the fastest and most complete open
   source AMQP solution available.
