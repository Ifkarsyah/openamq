Getting Started
**************

To run the OpenAMQ server you need (a) the openamqd server binary
somewhere on your path, and (b) a configured directory. To make life
easy, we provide these together in a single place, the openamq/servers
install directory.

The demo configuration has two virtual hosts, test and demo.  The
overall server configuration is in the amq_server.cfg file, and the
virtual host configurations are in amq_vhost.cfg in each virtual host
directory.

At present, the correct way to modify the configuration is to use
a simple text editor.

To avoid the problem of editing a configuration file that will be
replaced with each new version, OpenAMQ uses "layered configuration
files".  In each directory where you want to make changes, create a
new file called amq_custom.cfg and place your custom settings
inthat file.

Starting and Stopping the Server
********************************

The simplest way to start and stop the server is to run it using
the command:

    openamqd

and to stop it by typing Ctrl-C.

Under Unix/Linux the server can be run as a detached background
process using the command:

    openamqd -s

Under Win32 you can use the srvany tool (part of the Windows Resource Kit)
to register openamqd as a service.  Future versions of openamqd will
provide their own service management interface.

Server Administration
**********************
The server holds persistent message data in the data
subdirectory of each virtual host.  You may find it useful to
delete this data as a way of 'resetting' all the queues for a
server.  Do not do this while the server is running.

There are no other administration tools at present.  We foresee
a web-based administation interface in the future.
