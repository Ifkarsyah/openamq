Building OpenAMQ/JMS
********************

In order to build OpenAMQ/JMS you need:

 - Sun J2SE 5.0 JDK, which can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/
 - Apache Ant 1.7.0 or newer, which can be downloaded from
   http://ant.apache.org/

To build, please ensure that Ant and your JDK are installed correctly,
and that the JAVA_HOME environment variable, if set, is pointing to the
root directory of the JDK that you wish to build OpenAMQ/JMS with.

Then, run the following:

    > ant

This will build OpenAMQ/JMS and test classes, and leave the JAR files in
the dist directory of the distribution.

To install the JAR files into an OpenAMQ IBASE, you can run

    > ant install

which will install them into $IBASE/java/lib, if the IBASE environment
variable is set.

For other useful targets, try:

    > ant -projecthelp
