OpenAMQ Features
****************

Ease of Use
===========

 - Single stand-alone binary.
 - Natively portable to all modern operating systems.
 - Runs with zero configuration if needed.
 - Configurable through command-line switches.

Message Routing
===============

 - Create and manage exchanges (limited to 64k exchanges per server).
 - Implements the AMQP fanout, direct, topic and header exchange types.
 - Hierarchical topics of any complexity (limited to 128k topics per exchange).

Message Queuing
===============

 - Create and manage named or unnamed queues (limited to 64k queues per server).
 - Basic content messages of zero bytes up to 4Gb.
 - Multiple readers per queue with round-robin dispatching
 - Asynchonous message publishing and dispatching.
 - Shared queues and exclusive private queues.

Resource Management
===================

 - Configurable limits on queue sizes.
 - Configurable limits on maximum memory used for messages.
 - Automatic slowing of heavy publishers when limits are exceeded.

Clustering and Failover
=======================

 - Create server clusters of any size.
 - Fanout publish/subscribe load across many servers.
 - Configurable client-server heartbeating.

Security
========

 - Configurable user definitions.
 - SASL authentication (PLAIN mechanism).

Administration
==============

 - Configuration via XML configuration files or command-line.
 - Remote administration and configuration (amq_shell).

Logging
=======

 - Configurable debug logging levels.
 - Logging of normal client application accesses.
 - Logging of all exceptional events, warnings, and errors.
 - Automatic daily cycling of log files.
 - Configurable log archiving process (compression, removal, etc.)

Automation
==========

 - Includes full test client (amq_client).
 - PAL scripting language for automation and testing.
 - Console extension protocol.

WireAPI Client Principal Features
=================================

 - Support for all methods defined in the AMQP standard.
 - Asynchronous background message delivery.
 - Error reporting to applications.
 - Currently available for C and C++.

Coming Soon...
==============

Planned and/or in progress:

 - Secure SASL authentication mechanisms.
 - TLS/SSL Encryption.

 - Persistent messages and transactions.
 - WireAPI clients for Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java.

Technical Features
******************

Code Platform
=============

 - Portable to Linux, Windows, Solaris, and other POSIX systems.
 - Single code base builds both single-threaded and multi-threaded versions.

Performance and Stability
=========================

 - Built on a low-latency, high-throughput communications framework.
 - Configurable TCP/IP parameters (timeouts, buffers).
 - Configurable OS footprint (memory, number of threads).
 - Configurable memory managers (including heap caching).
 - Processes 40-50k transient messages per second on single CPU.
 - Processes 120-140k transient messages per second on multiway box.
