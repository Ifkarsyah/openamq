 - OpenAMQ Clustering - [/doc_clustering.txt_flat.html:flat HTML] | [/doc_clustering.html:full HTML] | [/doc_clustering.pdf:PDF (X pages)]

Analyses the requirements for OpenAMQ local-area and wide-area clustering
and defines a generic clustering model based on simple and easy to manage
elements.  The clustering model provides two main functionalities: the use
of high-availability pairs of servers and the ability to partition groups of
client applications, for reasons of scalability and geographic distribution.

 - AMQ Background - [/doc_background.txt_flat.html:flat HTML] | [/doc_background.html:full HTML] | [/doc_background.pdf:PDF (29 pages)]

Explains the rationale behind the development of AMQ as an architecture
and AMQP as a new industry standard protocol.  This document is designed
as useful background material for people wishing to understand the AMQP
design.

 - OpenAMQ Matching - [/doc_matching.txt_flat.html:flat HTML] | [/doc_matching.html:full HTML] | [/doc_matching.pdf:PDF (8 pages)]

Describes a matching algorithm that provides all the functionality needed
for topic matching and most of the functionality needed for content-based
routing.

 - OpenAMQ Concepts - [/doc_concepts.txt_flat.html:flat HTML] | [/doc_concepts.html:full HTML] | [/doc_concepts.pdf:PDF (X pages)]

A general introduction to the OpenAMQ project, intended for a
technically-minded readership. It explains the basic AMQ concepts, and
goes into medium detail on all significant aspects of the architecture
and technology.

Annex Specifications
********************

 - The WireAPI Specifications - [/doc_wireapi.txt_flat.html:flat HTML] | [/doc_wireapi.html:full HTML] | [/doc_wireapi.pdf:PDF (17 pages)]

Describes a standard API for application developers that wish to use
the AMQP for messaging services in their applications.  WireAPI is a
standard cross-language API that gives developers full access to the
full functionality of the AMQP protocol.

 - OpenAMQ Console Interface - [/doc_console.txt_flat.html:flat HTML] | [/doc_console.html:full HTML] | [/doc_console.pdf:PDF (17 pages)]

Defines a standard for remote administration of OpenAMQ servers; the
standard consists of an XML language that defines objects and methods,
and a transport mechanism that is itself built on top of AMQP.
