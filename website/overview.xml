The Goals of the Project
************************

Define a Standard Protocol
==========================

There is no industry standard middleware protocol.  A standard
protocol is necessary for interoperability and competition between
vendors' implementations.

Build a Reference Server
========================

A reference server implementation is the only way to verify that
the standard wire-level protocol is well-formed and feasible to
implement.

Build a Set of Client APIs
==========================

Creating a set of client APIs saves developers the cost of learning
the wire-level protocol.  There exist industry-standard APIs, such as
JMS, which we (will) conform to.

Create an Open Source Project
=============================

OpenAMQ is designed as an open source project that will promote the
AMQP wire-level protocol and the AMQ standard architecture.

The AMQP Wire-Level Protocol
****************************

AMQP has these features:

 - High-level: implements a set of generic primitives that
   can be easily mapped to standard message-oriented middleware use cases.
 - Modern: uses channel multiplexing, security negotiation, MIME typing,
   and many other 'best of breed' techniques.
 - Efficient: uses fast binary data structures.
 - Pervasive: portable to any operating system with network I/O.
 - Standard: will be proposed as an IETF standard.

The Reference Server
********************

The OpenAMQ server has these features:

 - Small, fast, efficient single-process server
 - A complete implementation of AMQP
 - Portable to Linux, Solaris, Unix, Win32
 - Built in ANSI C, using iMatix technology

More information: [/server.html:The OpenAMQ server]

The Client APIs
***************

The OpenAMQ client APIs have these features:

 - Providing a JMS-like interface, with extensions
 - Implemented in Java, C, COM
 - Planned implementations: Perl, C++

The Open Source Project
***********************

The OpenAMQ open source project is still under construction.
