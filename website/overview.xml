      <h1>The Goals of the Project</h1>

      <h2>Define a Standard Protocol</h2>
        <p>There is no industry standard middleware protocol.  A standard
        protocol is necessary for interoperability and competition between
        vendors' implementations.
        </p>

      <h2>Build a Reference Server</h2>
        <p>A reference server implementation is the only way to verify that
        the standard wire-level protocol is well-formed and feasible to
        implement.
        </p>

      <h2>Build a Set of Client APIs</h2>
        <p>Creating a set of client APIs saves developers the cost of learning
        the wire-level protocol.  There exist industry-standard APIs, such as
        JMS, which we (will) conform to.
        </p>

      <h2>Create an Open Source Project</h2>
        <p>OpenAMQ is designed as an open source project that will promote the
        AMQP protocol and the AMQ standard architecture.
        </p>

      <h1>The AMQP Specifications</h1>
        <p>AMQP has these features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiplexes channels over a single socket connection</li>
          <li>Handles messages of any size by fragmentation</li>
          <li>Messages are handled as opaque binary data, tagged with
          MIME types for application use</li>
          <li>All data is length-specified binary</li>
          <li>Security is negotiated using SASL</li>
          <li>Standard 3-digit reply codes</li>
          <li>Fully asynchronous flow of data between client and server</li>
          <li>Supports command batches and transactions</li>
          <li>Negotiation of server and client capabilities</li>
          <li>Ability to pass data using out-of-band techniques (zero-copy)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See: <a href="protocol.html">The AMQP protocol</a>
        </p>

      <h1>The Reference Server</h1>
        <p>The OpenAMQ server has these features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small, fast, efficient single-process server</li>
          <li>A complete implementation of AMQP</li>
          <li>Portable to Linux, Solaris, Unix, Win32</li>
          <li>Built in ANSI C, using iMatix technology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See: <a href="server.html">The OpenAMQ server</a>
        </p>

      <h1>The Client APIs</h1>
        <p>The OpenAMQ client APIs have these features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing a JMS-like interface, with extensions</li>
          <li>Implemented in Java, C, COM</li>
          <li>Planned implementations: Perl, C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See: <a href="clients.html">The OpenAMQ clients</a>
        </p>

      <h1>The Open Source Project</h1>
        <p>The OpenAMQ open source project is still under construction.
