Why Build from Source?
**********************

Building from source lets you tune and customise your OpenAMQ software:

 - Building for other platforms than those we provide binaries for.
 - Choosing a single-threaded or multithreaded version, to get the best
   performance out of your hardware.
 - Choosing a release or debug build.
 - Enabling other compile-time options.

Overview of the Build Process
*****************************

The Unix and Windows packages have identical contents but the text
files they contain are formatted for Unix and Windows respectively.
If you attempt to build the Windows file on Linux, Solaris or an other
Unix system, you will get shell errors unless you convert all files
(using zip or some similar tool).

OpenAMQ depends on multiple supporting packages, which are built as
part of the process. However, you do not need to download any other
software to build and run OpenAMQ - the OpenAMQ source kits are
self-complete and contain qualified and tested versions of all required
supporting packages.

Quick Guide to Building on Unix
*******************************

These shell commands build OpenAMQ from the Unix source kit:

    $ IBASE=$HOME/ibase
    $ export IBASE
    $ PATH=$IBASE/bin:$PATH
    $ export PATH
    $ tar zxvf /path/to/OpenAMQ-$(main_version).tar.gz
    $ cd /path/to/OpenAMQ-$(main_version)
    $ sh build.sh

Quick Guide to Building on Windows
**********************************

These Windows console commands build OpenAMQ from the Windows source kit:

    > set IBASE=c:\\ibase
    > set PATH=%IBASE%\\bin;%PATH%
    > unzip \\path\\to\\OpenAMQ-$(main_version).zip
    > cd \\path\\to\\OpenAMQ-$(main_version)
    > build
