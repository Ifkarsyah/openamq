Source kits
***********

The .tar.gz package and .zip packages are identical except that
the text files they contain are formatted for POSIX and Win32
respectively.  You can convert line endings using zip (-l and -a
options) but we suggest you simply unpack the appropriate file.

POSIX - Linux, Solaris, Unix
****************************

Requirements
============

 - Solaris 8 or later, or Linux 2.4 or later
 - GNU development tools: tar, gunzip, make, gcc, ar

Building from the Source Package
================================

Select an installation directory.  For instance, $HOME.
This is where the compiled/linked programs will be installed.
We call this the IBASE directory.

After detarring, change to the freshly created directory and
run this command:

    configure --with-ibase=IBASE-DIRECTORY

Alternatively, define an environment variable 'IBASE' with
this directory as its value, and then run 'configure':

    configure

Now build using this command:

    make

Installing the Server and Clients
=================================

Install into the IBASE directory using this command:

    make install

Windows 32
**********

Requirements
============

 - MSVC 6.x or later configured for command-line compilation
 - A standard unzip tool (note: WinZip does not handle the supplied
   tar.gz files correctly).

Under Win32 the MS C/C++ compiler must be configured for command-line
use.  During MSVC installation, make sure you register the environment
variables needed for command-line use of the compiler.  Check the
vcvars32.bat script for correctness.  When you open a console box, the
MSVCDir variable must point correctly to the MSVC application directory.
You can set this in the system environment variables.

Select an installation directory.  For instance, C:\Home.
This is where the compiled/linked programs will be installed.
We call this the IBASE directory.

After unzipping, change to the freshly created directory and
run this command:

    configure --with-ibase=IBASE-DIRECTORY

Alternatively, define an environment variable 'IBASE' with
this directory as its value, and then run 'configure':

    configure

Now build using this command:

    nmake

Installing the Server and Clients
=================================

Install into the IBASE directory using this command:

    nmake install

Installed Components
********************

All installed components are placed under the IBASE directory;
you can delete the OpenAMQ installation by deleting this directory.
The working directory used during building is not needed to run
OpenAMQ.

The IBASE directory has these subdirectories:

 - openamq/server - the OpenAMQ server along with a demo configuration
 - openamq/clients - the OpenAMQ clients
 - openamq/tests - a set of regression tests
 - bin - tools
 - lib - libraries, including the OpenAMQ client API libraries
 - include - C header files, including the OpenAMQ client API headers
 - doc - all available project documentation


Testing your Server Installation
********************************

We are still preparing the regression test suite.  In the meantime:

 - Go to the IBASE/openamq/server directory and run openamqd.

 - In a second window, go to the IBASE/openamq/clients/stdc directory and
   run amqpcli_serial.  This sends 1000 messages to a queue on the
   server and reads them back.
