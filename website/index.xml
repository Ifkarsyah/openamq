      <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the OpenAMQ website. OpenAMQ is a commodity middleware platform
        that implements an industry-standard protocol - AMQP - as a high-performance
        server and client API.
        </p>

      <h2>The AMQP Protocol</h2>
        <p>AMQP is a standardised wire-protocol for high-performance message exchange
        between a server and a set of clients.  It supports the standard models of
        point-to-point queuing, publish-subscribe, and file-transfer, in a modern and
        language-independent manner.
        </p>
        <p>See: <a href="protocol.html">The AMQP protocol.</a>
        </p>

      <h2>The OpenAMQ Server</h2>
        <p>This is a fast open source implementation of AMQP that runs on all
        modern platforms (Linux, Win32, Solaris, other Unixes).  OpenAMQ is written
        in ANSI C and is highly configurable for specific messaging scenarios or
        memory/performance constraints.
        </p>
        <p>See: <a href="server.html">The OpenAMQ server.</a>
        </p>

      <h2>The OpenAMQ Clients</h2>
        <p>Whatever your preferred language, you will find an OpenAMQ library or API
        that gives you seamless access to AMQP services.  Most of the OpenAMQ clients
        use the standard JMS (Java Messaging Services) model, with extensions.  It
        typically takes 1-2 days to start using OpenAMQ in your applications.
        </p>
        <p>Since AMQP is an open standard, you can write your own client layers.
        The average effort is about 10-20 days.
        </p>
