Welcome
*******

Welcome to the OpenAMQ website. OpenAMQ is a commodity middleware platform
that implements an industry-standard protocol - AMQP - as a high-performance
server and client API.

The Advanced Message Queues Protocol (AMQP)
===========================================

AMQP is a standardised wire-protocol for high-performance message exchange
between a server and a set of clients.  It supports the standard models of
point-to-point queuing, publish-subscribe, and file-transfer, in a modern and
language-independent manner.

See: [/protocol.html:The AMQ protocol]

The OpenAMQ Server
===================

This is a fast open source implementation of AMQP that runs on all
modern platforms (Linux, Win32, Solaris, other Unixes).  OpenAMQ is written
in ANSI C and is highly configurable for specific messaging scenarios or
memory/performance constraints.

See: [/server.html:The OpenAMQ server]

The OpenAMQ Clients
===================

Whatever your preferred language, you will find an OpenAMQ library or API
that gives you seamless access to AMQP services.  Most of the OpenAMQ clients
use the standard JMS (Java Messaging Services) model, with extensions.  It
typically takes 1-2 days to start using OpenAMQ in your applications.

Since AMQP is an open standard, you can write your own client layers.
The average effort is about 10-20 days.
