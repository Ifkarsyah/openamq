iMatix Corporation announces major new messaging product

Brussels, 15 March 2007: iMatix Corporation has released OpenAMQ/1.2, a
major new messaging product, as free software.  OpenAMQ is a mature and
tested AMQP product consisting of: high-performance messaging broker,
client libraries for C/C++, protocol scripting framework, remote operator
console, failover clustering, broker federation, extensive documentation.

iMatix CEO Pieter Hintjens says, "iMatix's free software has a reputation
for being tough, fast, easy to use, and well documented.  OpenAMQ is no
exception: we spent over eighteen months road-testing this software under
extreme conditions, in the heart of JPMorganChase's most important trading
system.  OpenAMQ handles 100 million messages each day for JPMorganChase
across London, Tokyo, New York, and Johannesburg, and it does this reliably
and quickly."

OpenAMQ focusses on simplicity of use, speed, and reliability.  Hintjens
explains: "we don't try to cover the whole market.  We focus on making the
most reliable, unbreakable server possible.  Less is more: while the
protocol (AMQP) provides very complex features, we implement the most
essential core, and we make it fast and robust."

Hintjens continues: "Our broker can pump around 140,000 messages per
second.  We're developing new technologies that can break the 1 million
msg/sec barrier.  People may find this unbelievable, but remember: we wrote
the original AMQP specs, and we know this space better than anyone."

The software was built entirely in C, is fully multithreaded, supports up
to 128-way SMP, and runs on Linux, Solaris, and Windows.  OpenAMQ is fully
interoperable with other AMQP products such as RabbitMQ and QPid.

OpenAMQ/1.2 is released under the GPL (broker) and BSD license (client
libraries) at www.openamq.org.
